# Applying-Various-CNN-Networks-on-MNIST-Dataset
This repositor demonstrates the result of applied various CNN networks on the MNIST dataset.

<hr>

#### First We Understand The MNIST DataSet

- The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning & deeplearning

- The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

- Half of the training set and half of the test set were taken from NIST's training dataset, while the other half of the training set and the other half of the test set were taken from NIST's testing dataset.

#### Step By Step Procedure

- Tried various models with diffrent hidden layer architecture and diffrent Approches (Kernel size,maxpooling, activation, optimizer, regularizer, padding and dropout)

- ploting loss with each epoch of model
